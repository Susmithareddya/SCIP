# SCIP Homepage Prototype

This repository contains a static prototype of the SCIP (Smart Coatings Intelligence Platform) homepage. It uses vanilla HTML and CSS only—no build tools are required.

## Viewing locally

You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, or start a simple local server to preserve relative asset paths:

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the page.
